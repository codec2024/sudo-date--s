# sudo date -s

This is a script that allows you to set the correct date and time on your Linux machine on startup. You can start this automatically on startup as a fix for a broken, dead, or weak CMOS Battery which causes the time to reset every time you turn your machine off. So instead of manually typing it, you can just start this script or automatically run in, and you only have to type the date and time you want to set it in:

Format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
Example: 2024-12-17 14:46:00
